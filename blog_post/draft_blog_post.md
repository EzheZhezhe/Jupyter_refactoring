### Introduction ###

All people in the world can be easily divided into three major categories:

* those who love Jupyter notebooks

* those who hate Jupyter notebooks

* those who have nave heard about Jupyter notebooks.

My post is about the first two groups.

I still remember that day when I was tasked with two machine learning models deployment and was handed over an [Untitled4.ipynb](https://twitter.com/vboykis/status/931212461436538881?s=20) with more than 126 cells executed in random order written by a Data Scientist, who has recently left the company.

### Goal of this post ###

To help Data Scientis write clean and maintenable code in Jupyter notebooks, and make life for Machine Learning, DevOps, Data and Software Engineers a little bit easier.

### Step 1: Sanity check ###

what is the end goal of this notebook , is it EDA , feature engineering, modelling, model evaluation, model tuning or the full package?

### Step 2: Separate environment ###

start with conda env , link how to use conda env with Jupyter notebook

### Step 3: Meaningful naming ###

variables ---> proper names (show bad examples, good examples and the best ones)
